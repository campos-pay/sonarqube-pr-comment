## Requirements
Github Token secret is automatically created by Github, you just need to reference on your workflow.

A previous step must have run an analysis on your code.

Read more information on how to analyze your code [here](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/github-integration/)

## Usage

The workflow YAML file will usually look something like this::

```yaml
on:
  # Trigger analysis when pushing in master or pull requests, and when creating
  # a pull request. 
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
name: Main Workflow
jobs:
  sonarqube:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        # Disabling shallow clone is recommended for improving relevancy of reporting.
        fetch-depth: 0

    # Triggering SonarQube analysis as results of it are required by Quality Gate check.
    - name: SonarQube Scan
      uses: sonarsource/sonarqube-scan-action@master
      env:
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}

         sonar_projectkey: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
         github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
         repo_name: ${{ github.repository }}
         pr_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
